# Smart Mining Starter Pack

This repository holds the initial work we are doing for the mining use cases in Chile including OEE and base model for mining interoperability.

NOTE: ⚠️ This application is not supported by InterSystems Corporation. Use it at your own risk.

## Option 1: Build and run development version

### Download Docker base image
[Docker Image](ftp://ftppublic.intersystems.com/pub/starterpack/starterpack-base-irisint.tar)

Install with:
```bash
docker load -i starterpack-base-irisint.tar
```
### Clone Repo and run
```bash
git clone git@github.com:intersystems/asp-mining.git
cd asp-mining
./build.sh
./run.sh [-d,all]
```

## Option 2: Download and run a prebuilt docker image
Download a ready to go image with 1 month of anonymized data on it. (You need at least 50GB of storage available for the uncompressed docker to run properly)
[ASP-Mining v1.0.0 with data](ftp://ftppublic.intersystems.com/pub/starterpack/aspmining_1.0.0-data.tar.gz)
```
# To load the image run:
gunzip aspmining_1.0.0-data.tar.gz
docker load -i aspmining_1.0.0-data.tar
docker run intersystemsdc/mining:1.0.0-data
```

## Setting up mining dataset in SQL Server

###  Clone a Linux Local DB
Run a Docker SQL Server 2019, using the provided MiningDBsV2.tar file and follow the instructions inside the README file. [Download Here](ftp://ftppublic.intersystems.com/pub/starterpack/MiningDBsV2.tar)

## Testing the Production
The development production is disabled by default to reduce the time spent when relaunching the docker image, and better controlling the excecution of the Business Services in the Package when doing changes in the code.

### 1. Open the Default Production and enable one of the service.

### 2. Run the production for at least 5 minutes to import a couple days worth of data.

## Check the FrontEnd app
[Follow the instructions in here](https://github.com/intersystems/asp-mining/tree/master/FrontEnd) 


## Creating a Snapshot of the running image
To create a snapshot of the ASP-Mining, with custom data and settings. You can perform the following steps:
```
docker stop aspmining
docker save aspmining > mysnapshot.tar

#Then you can load this file in a different machine like:
docker load -i mysnapshot.tar
```

## Want to Use IAM?
[Follow the instructions in here](https://github.com/intersystems/asp-mining/tree/master/Docs/iam) 

## Where is the Management Portal and what are my credentials?

Here is the list of end points:
* IRIS OEE - http://localhost:52773/csp/sys/UtilHome.csp
  * The credentials are: SuperUser/sys
* Zeppelin - http://localhost:10000
* Spark:
  * Spark UI: http://localhost:10001 - This is only available after running one spark job
  * Spark Cluster: http://localhost:8080

## Where is the Quick ML instructions?

1. Enable the production
